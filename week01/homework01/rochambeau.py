# Description:
#
# * The program should ask the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then, it
# should repeat back to the user their choice, "reveal" its own choice, and
# report the results. See below for two possible example runs. The program can
# play fairly, can always win, or can always lose--it's up to you. The example
# below shows how it can always win! Briefly, in the game of rock-paper-scissors,
# rock defeats scissors, scissors defeat paper, and paper defeats rock.
#
# * You may assume that the user will input one of rock, paper, or scissors.
# Case matters! We'll stick with lowercase.
#
# You may write the dialog however you like--below is an example dialog if you'd
# like one to follow. We are 'positive' that you can improve on this interaction,
# however! Here are two distinct runs of the program:
#
# Choose your weapon: rock
# the user (you) chose rock
# the comp (I) chose paper
# Ha! I really chose paper -- I WIN!
#
# Choose your weapon: paper
# the user (you) chose paper
# the comp (I) chose dynamite
# I REALLY WIN!
